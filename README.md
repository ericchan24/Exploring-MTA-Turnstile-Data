# Exploring MTA Data

WomenTechWomenYes is a philanthropic organization that asked us for help with two tasks:   
1. Increasing the participation of women in technology  
2. Building awareness and reach by attracting gala attendees.  

To do this, we need to find the optimal placement for their street teams who will be stationed at New York City MTA subway entrances to gather emails from the public. To achieve this, we looked at MTA subway data to find the busiest stations for optimal placements of the street teams. We also looked at Zillow housing price information, taking into account the affluence of the station neighborhoods for maximizing fundraising potential.
